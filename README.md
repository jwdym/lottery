# Predicting Lottery Drawings
Can't be done! Well hopefully it can't, there's many ethical issues with a determinable outcome in a game of chance, but how would one even predict lottery drawings?

## Leveraging AI
Artifical Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) can do a lot of things from recommend movies you might like to writing essays for you, so why not predict your next lottery ticket? Well lots of reasons, while using a model isn't any better than rellying on the random number picks of any store, it shouldn't be any worse. This repo contains a notebook under the **notebooks** folder along with some historic Powerball data under the **data** folder.

I threw together a quick exploratory data analyis (EDA) to look into historic lottery drawings, and then built a poorly conceived model to go through and make predictions on lottery drawings based on historic outcomes.
